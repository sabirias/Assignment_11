    "ANS:- The \"close()\" function in Python is used to \"close an open file\". Let's explore why it's important to close files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Resource Management:\n",
    "    - When you open a file using \"open()\", the operating system allocates resources (such as memory) to handle the file.\n",
    "    - Failing to close the file leaves these resources tied up, potentially causing memory leaks or other issues.\n",
    "    - By calling \"close()\", you release these resources back to the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Consistency:\n",
    "    - When writing to a file, data is often buffered in memory before being physically written to the file.\n",
    "    - If you don't close the file, the buffered data may not be written completely, leading to incomplete or corrupted files.\n",
    "    - Closing the file ensures that all data is flushed and written properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. File Locking:\n",
    "    - Some operating systems lock files while they are open.\n",
    "    - If you don't close the file, other processes or programs may be unable to access or modify it.\n",
    "    - Properly closing the file releases the lock.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Good Practice:\n",
    "    - Explicitly closing files is considered good programming practice.\n",
    "    - It makes your code more robust and easier to maintain.\n",
    "    - It also helps prevent unexpected behavior in complex programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to \"always close files after\" you're done reading from or writing to them. It's a small but crucial step in ensuring efficient and reliable file handling."

    "ANS:- The 'with' statement in Python is used in conjunction with the 'open()' function for file handling.\n",
    "      \n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Resource Management:\n",
    "    - The primary advantage of using the 'with' statement is 'automatic resource management'.\n",
    "    - When you open a file using 'with', it automatically takes care of closing the file when you're done with it.\n",
    "    - No need to explicitly call 'file.close()'. The file is closed automatically when the block of code exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Context Management:\n",
    "    - The 'with' statement establishes a 'context' for the file operations.\n",
    "    - It ensures that any setup or teardown actions (like opening and closing the file) are handled correctly.\n",
    "    - The context is created when entering the `with` block and destroyed when exiting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cleaner Code:\n",
    "    - Using 'with' makes your code 'cleaner and more readable'.\n",
    "    - It clearly indicates the scope where the file is being used.\n",
    "    - No need to worry about forgetting to close the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Exception Safety:\n",
    "    - If an exception occurs within the `with` block, the file is still properly closed.\n",
    "    - This ensures 'exception safety' and prevents resource leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Example:\n",
    "    # Without 'with' statement\n",
    "    file = open(\"myfile.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    file.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # With 'with' statement\n",
    "    with open(\"myfile.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "        content = file.read()\n",
    "    # File is automatically closed when exiting the 'with' block\n",
    "\n",
    "    # More concise and safer!\n",
    "\n",

    "    - It writes the specified content as a \"single line\" in the text file.\n",
